Project Description
The platform features a striking animated landing page that immediately welcomes visitors and invites them to explore highlighted categories. Each fundraising category (e.g., Medical, Education, Animal) is displayed as a vibrant, animated card with a unique hover effect, designed to be inviting and intuitive for both desktop and mobile users.

A navigation bar provides smooth transitions between essential sections, including About Us, Get Involved, Donate, and FAQ, with the Home button linking directly to the landing page. The site uses advanced grid layouts and responsive CSS, ensuring all pages and features look professional on any device.
